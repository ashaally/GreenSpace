            <br>Who is benefits? Because Green Infrastructure is multi-functional, it is capable of delivering a variety of benefits in a range of situations.
            Where is it? Everywhere. Anywhere.
            For example, in an urban setting, it is possible to see how linking a green space with a pond and a stream by creating a wildlife-friendly footpath corridor, would improve the ecology of the green space and pond, while providing additional opportunities for human recreation. In a rural situation it may be planning to block old drains in upland moorland areas to retain water in the uplands, creating a ‘sponge’ effect to reduce lowland flooding, improve water quality and restore boggy habitats, helping people and wildlife alike.
